"""Serializes the actions a target would run, so they can key a nested test.

A nested `bazel build` is opaque to the outer Bazel, so a change in the rules
that alters how the fixture is built does not invalidate the test that drives
it. The command lines do change, though, and an aspect can read them: writing
them to a file and declaring that file as a test input makes the test re-run
exactly when the fixture's build actually changed.

The fixture is analysed under the toolchains the nested `bazel` registers, so a
change in one of those lands in the command lines too.

Command lines carry output paths, and those name the configuration they were
built in, so the fingerprint would otherwise differ under every flag the outer
build happens to set and re-run the test for nothing. The configuration segment
is dropped, in the spirit of Bazel's own path mapping. What is left out: actions
that write a file rather than run a command line (`ctx.actions.write`, template
expansion) contribute their mnemonic and nothing else, so a change to what such
an action writes does not reach the fingerprint.
