"""Macros for asserting the outcome of a nested `bazel <command>` of a target.

Bazel has no native "run bazel and assert on the outcome" rule, so we wrap an
`sh_test` around `expect_build_failure.sh` (which runs a nested `bazel build`,
`bazel test` or `bazel coverage`). These macros let callers declare intent --
the target, the subcommand, and the messages the output must/mustn't contain --
instead of hand-assembling the script's raw args, `$(rootpath ...)` expansions,
runfiles, and boilerplate tags on every call.

- `expect_build_failure_test` asserts a `bazel build` fails.
- `expect_build_success_test` asserts a `bazel build` succeeds (e.g. a fixture
  that only builds under a specific flag or toolchain override).
- `expect_test_failure_test` asserts a `bazel test` (or `bazel coverage`) fails.
- `expect_test_success_test` asserts a `bazel test` succeeds (e.g. a fixture that
  only passes under a specific `--test_filter` or inherited env var).

All four share the same script and nested-Bazel plumbing.

A label inside a `build_args`/`bazel_args` flag value (e.g.
`--extra_toolchains=//pkg:toolchain`) is passed through as-is: unlike
`target`, it is not absolutized against the caller's package, because the
nested `bazel` runs from the workspace root. Always write such a label out in
full, even for a toolchain defined in the same package as the caller.
