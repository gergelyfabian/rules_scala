"""Macros for asserting the outcome of a nested `bazel <command>` of a target.

Bazel has no native "run bazel and assert on the outcome" rule, so we wrap an
`sh_test` around `expect_build_failure.sh` (which runs a nested `bazel build`,
`bazel test` or `bazel coverage`). These macros let callers declare intent --
the target, the subcommand, and the messages the output must/mustn't contain --
instead of hand-assembling the script's raw args, `$(rootpath ...)` expansions,
runfiles, and boilerplate tags on every call.

- `expect_build_failure_test` asserts a `bazel build` fails.
- `expect_build_success_test` asserts a `bazel build` succeeds (e.g. a fixture
  that only builds under a specific flag or toolchain override).
- `expect_test_failure_test` asserts a `bazel test` (or `bazel coverage`) fails.
- `expect_test_success_test` asserts a `bazel test` succeeds (e.g. a fixture that
  only passes under a specific `--test_filter` or inherited env var).

All four share the same script and nested-Bazel plumbing.

A label inside a `build_args`/`bazel_args` flag value (e.g.
`--extra_toolchains=//pkg:toolchain`) is passed through as-is: unlike
`target`, it is not absolutized against the caller's package, because the
nested `bazel` runs from the workspace root. Always write such a label out in
full, even for a toolchain defined in the same package as the caller.

Cacheability
------------
The nested `bazel` builds from the git checkout on disk, not from the runfiles
the outer Bazel handed this test. So the files that decide whether the test
passes are not inputs of the test, and Bazel would serve a stale pass. These
tests therefore name those files by hand:

- the fixture's own package (globbed below); a fixture in another package is
  tagged `external` only if `target` is a pattern, because a macro cannot
  verify that caller `data` covers every source of a pattern -- a concrete
  cross-package label gets fingerprinted below instead, and needs
  `target`'s visibility to reach the caller's package;
- the toolchains a `--extra_toolchains` flag registers, by analysing the
  fixture under them (see collect_actions.bzl);
- the repo `.bazelrc`, which CI steps append to, so two steps that differ only
  by those lines no longer share one result;
- `MODULE.bazel` and its lock, which fix the dependency versions;
- `.bazelversion`, which picks the Bazel binary the nested build runs;
- the jars of the compiler and of the test runners, because the fixture's
  command line carries their paths and not their content;
- a fingerprint of the actions the fixture and its dependencies run (see
  collect_actions.bzl). This is what makes an edit to the rules re-run the test.

Editing `.bazelversion` re-runs the tests. What that file cannot catch is a CI
step which leaves it alone and points bazelisk at another binary. One step does
that (`last_green`), and it keeps its own cache key regardless, because it
appends three flags to `.bazelrc`, which is on the list above.

Outside the list is whatever the network serves while external repositories are
fetched. `MODULE.bazel.lock` pins the versions, so what is exposed is a flaky
download rather than a silent change in what is being tested. Catching an input
nobody thought of would take a run with `--nocache_test_results` on the branch
we merge into, which means a step in `.bazelci/presubmit.yml`; this change does
not touch CI configuration.

A fixture that fails during analysis never runs an action, so there is nothing
to fingerprint and no honest cache key for it. Assert on such a target with
expect_analysis_failure_test, which asks Bazel directly.

    """Declares an `sh_test` asserting that `bazel test`/`bazel coverage` of `target` succeeds.

    Same plumbing as `expect_test_failure_test`, but the nested run is expected
    to pass. Useful for a fixture that only passes under a specific
    `--test_filter`, an inherited env var, or a specific toolchain, which this
    wrapper supplies via `bazel_args`/`env`.

    Args:
        name: test target name.
        target: label whose nested run must succeed. A package-relative label
            (`":foo"` or `"foo"`) is resolved against this package. The caller
            must tag this fixture `"manual"`: it only passes with the flags
            this wrapper supplies, so a plain wildcard `bazel test //...`
            would run it without them and fail.
        command: the bazel subcommand to run; `"test"` (default) or `"coverage"`.
        bazel_args: extra flags forwarded verbatim to the nested `bazel <command>`
            (e.g. `"--test_filter=A"`, `"--extra_toolchains=//some:toolchain"`).
        bazel_arg_files: file labels each holding one extra flag as its
            (newline-stripped) contents, forwarded to the nested `bazel <command>`
            just like `bazel_args`. Use this instead of `bazel_args` for a flag
            whose value the `sh_test` args pipeline would mangle -- a space, or a
            shell metacharacter the Windows launcher's `bash -c` would interpret
            (e.g. a `--test_filter` regex containing `(`/`|`/`$`). Automatically
            added to the test's `data`.
        env: dict of KEY: VALUE exported into the nested `bazel` client env before
            the run (e.g. to feed the target's `env_inherit`).
        worker_sandboxing: see `expect_build_failure_test`.
        expect: file labels whose (newline-stripped) contents must appear in the
            output. Automatically added to the test's `data`.
        reject: file labels whose (newline-stripped) contents must NOT appear in
            the output. Automatically added to the test's `data`.
        size: test size; defaults to `"large"`.
        tags: test tags; defaults to `["no-sandbox", "requires-network"]`.
        fingerprint_target: label whose actions key this test, when `target` is a
            pattern rather than one label. Defaults to `target`. Ignored when
            `target` is in another package: such a fixture is always tagged
            `external` instead (see the module docstring).
        no_fingerprint_reason: why no action fingerprint can key this test. Setting
            it tags the test `external`, so it re-runs every time instead of being
            served a result that cannot notice a change in the rules.
        **kwargs: forwarded to the underlying `sh_test` (e.g. extra `data`).
