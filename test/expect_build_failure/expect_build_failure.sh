#
# Runs a nested `bazel <command>` (build/test/coverage) of a target, asserts it
# fails (or, with --expect-success, succeeds), and that the combined output
# contains every expected message and none of the rejected messages.
#
# The nested `bazel` invocation (and the rationale for it) lives in the shared
# nested_bazel.sh helper this script sources.
#
# Usage:
#   expect_build_failure.sh --target <label> \
#       [--command <build|test|coverage>] \
#       [--expect-success] \
#       [--env <KEY=VALUE>]... \
#       [--bazel-arg <flag>]... \
#       [--bazel-arg-file <path>]... \
#       [--expect-file <path>]... \
#       [--reject-file <path>]...
#
#   --target          the label to act on.
#   --command         the bazel subcommand to run; defaults to `build`.
#   --expect-success  assert the invocation succeeds; by default it must fail.
#   --env             KEY=VALUE exported into the nested `bazel` client env before
#                     the invocation (e.g. to feed a target's `env_inherit`);
#                     repeatable.
#   --bazel-arg       extra option forwarded to the nested `bazel <command>` (e.g.
#                     `--repo_env=SCALA_VERSION=2.13.18` or `--extra_toolchains=...`);
#                     repeatable.
#   --bazel-arg-file  like --bazel-arg, but the (newline-stripped) contents of the
#                     given file are the flag. Use this for a flag whose value
#                     Bazel's `sh_test` args pipeline would mangle -- a space (see
#                     the note below) or a shell metacharacter that the Windows
#                     launcher's `bash -c` would interpret (e.g. a `--test_filter`
#                     regex with `(`/`|`/`$`); repeatable.
#   --clean-before-build  run `bazel clean` (no --expunge) against the nested
#                     output base before the real invocation. The caller
#                     (expect_build_success_test) passes this whenever it also
#                     has expect/reject files: unlike a failure, a successful
#                     action can be served from the nested output base's
#                     on-disk cache on a later run of this same test, silently
#                     skipping recompilation and so reprinting no output to
#                     check. `bazel clean` clears that without re-fetching the
#                     external repos the nested output base keeps warm.
#   --expect-file     file whose (newline-stripped) contents must appear in the
#                     output; repeatable.
#   --reject-file     file whose (newline-stripped) contents must NOT appear in the
#                     output; repeatable.
#
# Messages are passed as files rather than inline strings because Bazel subjects
# `sh_test` `args` to Bourne tokenization, which would split messages that
# contain spaces.
