# Shared helpers for driving a *nested* `bazel` invocation from inside an
# `sh_test`: "nested" in the sense of a `bazel` invocation running inside the
# action of a `bazel test`, not nested on disk. Bazel has no native "run bazel
# and assert on the outcome" rule, so the concrete tests (e.g. assert a build
# fails with a given message, or assert a macro emits no ijar) source this file
# and add their own assertions on top of `nested_bazel_run`.
#
# The nested invocation uses its own output base (the parent server holds an
# exclusive lock on its own) while sharing the parent's repository cache so it
# does not re-fetch every external repo from Maven.
#
# Usage (from a script that is run as an `sh_test`):
#   source ".../nested_bazel.sh"
#   nested_bazel_setup rules_scala_<something>_output_base
#   output="$(nested_bazel_run build --repo_env=SCALA_VERSION=2.13.18 //some:target 2>&1)"
#
# This file only defines functions; it is not meant to be executed directly. It
# does not enable shell options (`set -euo pipefail` etc.) -- that is left to the
# sourcing script -- but every function is safe under `set -u`.

# Prints the absolute path of the real source workspace root, so the nested
# `bazel build` operates on the actual sources (and their `.bazelrc`) rather than
