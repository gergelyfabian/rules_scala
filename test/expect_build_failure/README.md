# Asserting that a build or a test fails

Two mechanisms live here. Pick by *when* the failure happens.

## Analysis-time failure: use `expect_analysis_failure_test`

A target that Bazel rejects while analysing it -- a `fail()` in a rule, a bad
attribute combination -- needs no build at all. `expect_analysis_failure_test`
(see `expect_analysis_failure.bzl`) asks Bazel in-process through
`bazel_skylib`'s `analysistest`. It is hermetic, cacheable and runs in under a
second.

## Execution-time failure: use the `expect_*` macros

A compile error, a failing test binary, a warning printed by an action: these
only appear once actions run, and Bazel has no native rule for "run a build and
assert it fails". So `expect_build_failure.bzl` wraps an `sh_test` around a
**nested `bazel`** invocation.

That nested build reads the real source tree, which the outer Bazel cannot see,
so the test has to declare by hand everything that decides its outcome. The
macro does that for you; the docstring in `expect_build_failure.bzl` lists what
goes into the cache key and what stays outside it.

Nothing re-runs these tests without the result cache on a schedule. That would be
the way to catch an input nobody thought to declare.

## What to delete later

- **On Bazel 8 or newer**, an aspect can reach toolchain dependencies through
  `aspect(toolchains_aspects = ...)`. That replaces `_SCALAC_JAR` and
  `_RUNNER_JARS`, which exist only because the fingerprint carries the tools'
  paths and not their content. This repo pins 7.7.1 in `.bazelversion`, where
  the parameter does not exist.
- **Most success cases do not need a nested build at all.** A Starlark
  transition can set `//command_line_option:extra_toolchains`, verified on
  Bazel 7.7.1: the same fixture fails with the `-Xmx1M` toolchain and builds
  with the `-Xmx1G` one when the flag is set that way. A test asserting a
  build *failure* still needs the nested build, because a target that fails
  cannot be a dependency. A test asserting *success* only needs it if it also
  checks the build output (`expect`/`reject`); one that just checks the build
  passed under a flag or toolchain override can be replaced with a transition
  plus `build_test`, which runs in-process and isn't `exclusive`, so it drops
  off the critical path these nested tests share today.
- **The whole nested driver** would go away by moving these tests to
  [`rules_bazel_integration_test`](https://github.com/bazel-contrib/rules_bazel_integration_test),
  which gives each test its own child workspace and an explicit `workspace_files`
  attribute. Then the inputs are declared by construction rather than by hand,
  the shared output base disappears, and with it the `exclusive` tag that
  serialises these tests today. The cost is moving 27 fixture packages into
  child workspaces, so it is a project rather than a patch.

## When you add a test here

Nothing in a caller has to know about caching. Three things are worth knowing:

- If the fixture lives in another package, it still gets a real fingerprint
  through `fixture_actions` when `target` is one concrete label. Only a
  cross-package *pattern* (a wildcard like `//pkg/...`) gets tagged `external`,
  because there's no single label a macro could fingerprint or a caller could
  declare as `data`.
- A nested build runs with a scrubbed `HOME`, so your `~/.bazelrc` is ignored.
  If you need it (a download proxy, say), pass `--nocache_test_results` and
  `--test_env=RULES_SCALA_NESTED_BAZEL_USE_REAL_HOME=1` to `bazel test`. The
  home file is outside this test's key, so keep this opt-in uncached.
- Analysis fails if the fingerprint carries no rules_scala action, because such
  a fingerprint cannot notice a change in the rules and the test it keys would
  stay green through a regression. Either point `fingerprint_target` at a label
  the nested build really compiles, or say why you cannot with
  `no_fingerprint_reason`, which tags the test `external` so it re-runs every
  time rather than being served a pass it cannot vouch for. A few tests do
  that today, for one of four reasons: `scala_proto` generates through an
  aspect of its own, whose actions this aspect cannot read; the `semanticdb`
  fixtures only build toolchain deps, so they compile nothing at all; a
  fixture targets a plain `proto_library`/`java_library`, which runs no
  rules_scala action either; or fingerprinting two fixtures under the same
  `--extra_toolchains` would analyse a shared dependency under two different
  aspect stacks, which Bazel reports as an `ActionConflictException`.

What the fingerprint does not see: an action that writes a file instead of
running a command line (`ctx.actions.write`, template expansion) contributes its
mnemonic and nothing else, so a change to what such an action writes leaves the
fingerprint identical. The same blind spot applies more broadly: an action's
command line carries a file's path, not its content, so a content-only change
to a file rules_scala itself reads by path (rather than compiles from a
fixture's own sources) also leaves the fingerprint identical -- `_SCALAC_JAR`
and `_RUNNER_JARS` below are declared as explicit `data` for exactly this
reason. Declaring the file such a write action produces as a test input
instead would put its output path -- and with it the configuration -- back
into the key, which is what makes the tests re-run under every flag the outer
build sets.

## Registering a toolchain

A toolchain the nested build registers decides whether that build fails, and it
is not part of the fixture's own graph. The macro handles this on its own: it
reads the `--extra_toolchains` flags out of the arguments it forwards and
analyses the fixture under exactly those toolchains, through a Starlark
transition on `//command_line_option:extra_toolchains`. Change a toolchain and
the command lines in the fingerprint change with it, so the test re-runs.

Nothing to declare in the toolchain's package, in other words. Verified by
setting `unused_dependency_checker_mode`, `strict_deps_mode` and
`dependency_mode` in `//scala:minimal_direct_source_deps` to values that would
make the assertion vacuous: each moves the fingerprint of the test that
registers it.
