# Asserts a target's output jar is announced in the Build Event Protocol: builds
# the target with --build_event_text_file and greps the resulting BES file for
# the jar's path. Parameterised so one script backs all the per-rule targets
# (see this package's BUILD).
#
# Args:
#   $1  the //test target label to build.
#   $2  the workspace-relative jar path expected in the BES stream.
#
# The signal is a generated BES file, not a build/test *outcome*, so this is a
# bespoke sh_test rather than an expect_build_failure.bzl macro. The nested
# `bazel` (and the rationale for it) lives in the shared nested_bazel.sh helper
# this script sources.
