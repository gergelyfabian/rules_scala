"""A repository whose one file lists every file rules_scala exposes to a
downstream consumer's `local_path_override` (see downstream_repository.bzl),
with its content hash.

`repository_ctx.watch_tree`'s `exclude` param (which would let this watch the
whole checkout root minus a short internal-only list) needs Bazel 8+; this
checkout pins 7.7.1 (.bazelversion). TODO(#1945): remove once Bazel is
updated to 8+. So instead `_PUBLIC_DIRS` below is the
list of top-level directories a `bazel_dep(rules_scala)` consumer can
actually load from -- verified against real `load()`s in docs/*.md,
examples/*/BUILD, and rules_scala's own scala/*.bzl (e.g. `scala/toolchains.bzl`
loads `//junit:junit.bzl`, `//specs2:specs2.bzl`, `//jmh/toolchain:toolchain.bzl`,
`//scalatest:scalatest.bzl` -- toolchain plumbing, not consumer-doc-page
material, but just as load-bearing) -- not just `scala/`, `src/`,
`third_party/`. `_INTERNAL_ENTRIES` are the rest of the top level: test/CI/dev
fixtures no consumer's build reaches. `exposed_top_level_dirs_test` fails
loudly, naming it, if a new top-level directory is in neither list -- so a
missed one shows up as a failing test, not a silently stale cache.

`downstream_test` declares this file as `data`, so an edit anywhere in scope
changes it, and `joern_test`/`dicer_test` re-run; nothing in scope changes it,
and an unrelated rerun is served `(cached) PASSED`.

Unlike a `local = True` repository rule, `repository_ctx.watch_tree` ties
re-evaluation to Bazel's own file-watching (added in Bazel 7.1.0 specifically
to replace `local`'s unreliable invalidation -- see
https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/16217) rather than "always treat as
stale", so this is skipped whenever nothing in scope changed.
