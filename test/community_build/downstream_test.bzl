"""Bazel-native downstream test: fetches a real external consumer as a
repository (see downstream_repository.bzl), then in the consumer's own
checkout, wired against *this* rules_scala checkout: first repins its Maven
lockfile(s) (`bazel run @maven//:pin`, since the consumer's exact pin may not
match a version this checkout's third_party repos carry), then runs a
nested `bazel test` against `targets`.

Cacheability
------------
The nested `bazel test` reads this checkout's *live* source tree via
`local_path_override` (see downstream_repository.bzl), not the runfiles this
`sh_test` was handed -- so rules_scala's own sources are code under test
without being declared inputs, the same unsound-caching trap
`test/expect_build_failure/expect_build_failure.bzl` fixes for its own nested
tests. `@rules_scala_source_fingerprint//:fingerprint.txt` (see
source_fingerprint.bzl) hashes every file rules_scala exposes to a downstream
consumer, so an edit anywhere in scope changes this `sh_test`'s declared
inputs and forces a re-run.

`no-sandbox` + `no-remote-exec` rather than `local`: `local` also precludes
the *local* test-result cache, not just sandboxing and remote execution (see
https://bazel.build/reference/be/common-definitions#test.tags) -- with it,
this test would never come back `(cached) PASSED` even on an unmodified rerun.

            a third-party consumer isn't expected to build against an
