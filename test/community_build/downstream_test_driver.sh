# Nested-bazel driver for `downstream_test`: runs `bazel test` inside a
# Bazel-fetched external consumer repo (see downstream_repository.bzl),
# against *this* rules_scala checkout via the `local_path_override` that
# repository rule already wrote into the consumer's MODULE.bazel.
#
# Usage: downstream_test_driver.sh --marker-rootpath <path> --scala-version <v> \
#   --output-base-name <name> [--extra-bazel-flags <flags>] -- <target-pattern>...
#
# Named flags because Bazel/rules_shell silently drops or mangles blank
# `args` entries -- same convention as test/expect_build_failure/expect_build_failure.sh.
