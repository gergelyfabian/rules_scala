# Runs //test:JunitTestWithDeps and asserts the generated JUnit XML report lists
# a <testcase> for the test's methods. `bazel test` only writes this test.xml to
# disk -- it never reaches stdout -- so, unlike the discovered-classes and
# --test_filter checks (now expect_test_success_test targets that match on the
# runner's stdout), this one reads the artifact directly and so needs a bespoke
# sh_test rather than one of the expect_build_failure.bzl macros.
#
# The nested `bazel test` (and the rationale for it) lives in the shared
# nested_bazel.sh helper this script sources.
